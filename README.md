## Rider-Driven-Cancellation-Prediction
#### **Background:**

At Shadowfax, part of the business includes delivering food orders from clients such as Swiggy and Zomato to customers. The typical order flow goes something like this:
- A client creates the order in our system
- The order gets allocated to a rider
- The rider accepts the order
- The rider goes to the pickup location
- The rider picks up the order
- The rider goes to the delivery location and delivers the order

The rider also has the option to get the order cancelled before delivery by calling the clientâ€™s call centre. We would like to predict this kind of cancellation before it happens so that we can try and reassign the order to another rider before it gets cancelled.

#### **Problem Statement:**

Given the order and rider details as described below, create a model that can predict rider-driven cancellation in advance (i.e. before getting marked as cancelled or delivered).

## **DATASET**
Kaggle link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/cascade-cup-22/data

## **FEATURE ENGINEERING**
### **New features added**

Average_mile_distance : Average distance the rider has to cover to deliver the order

diff1 : Timestamps difference between allot_time and order_time

diff2 : Timestamps difference between accept_time and order_time

Reassignment_method was encoded as follows:

reassignment_method ={'auto':1 ,'manual':2 ,'nan':3}

order_day and month: Day and month on which the order was placed

riders: Frequency of orders alloted to each rider in train and test dataset

order_change_final : Binary encoding of change in undelivered orders of a particular rider

## **MODEL**

The dataset was trained on catboost model and the AUC on validation data was around 0.95.

AUC on private dataset : 0.90134
