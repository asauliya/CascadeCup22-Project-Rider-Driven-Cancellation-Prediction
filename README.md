## Rider-Driven-Cancellation-Prediction
#### **Background:**

At Shadowfax, part of the business includes delivering food orders from clients such as Swiggy and Zomato to customers. The typical order flow goes something like this:
- A client creates the order in our system
- The order gets allocated to a rider
- The rider accepts the order
- The rider goes to the pickup location
- The rider picks up the order
- The rider goes to the delivery location and delivers the order

The rider also has the option to get the order cancelled before delivery by calling the clientâ€™s call centre. We would like to predict this kind of cancellation before it happens so that we can try and reassign the order to another rider before it gets cancelled.

#### **Problem Statement:**

Given the order and rider details as described below, create a model that can predict rider-driven cancellation in advance (i.e. before getting marked as cancelled or delivered).
